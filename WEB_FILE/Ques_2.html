                <b>Listening to music</b> is one of my favorite hobbies. It helps me relax and stay focused, especially after a long day of college and assignments. I enjoy a wide variety of genres including classical, lo-fi, and pop.

                Music creates a soothing environment in my hostel room. While lying on my bed, I often put on my headphones and <i>drift into the melodies</i>. It's my way of finding peace and solitude in the midst of a busy routine.
